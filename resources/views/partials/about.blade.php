					<p class="article-content text-justify">So many of us have become trapped in a situation where we have to use OTAs because thatâ€™s who our potential customers turn to first. The problem is the OTAs know this, and as a result have taken advantage of this by increasing our fees and introducing impossibly restrictive practices where those who benefit are no longer us, but the OTAs themselves.</p>
                    <p class="article-content text-justify">In a business where rapport, attention to detail and personal service are paramount, OTAs have driven a massive wedge between us and our customers, to the point where services across the board have become commoditized and the intrinsic value of hotel enterprises have reduced steadily over the years. This is a problem and BookingBase has been established to solve it.</p>
